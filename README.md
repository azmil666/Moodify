# 🌈 Moodify — AI-Powered Theme-Changing Chrome Extension

**Moodify** is a Chrome extension that changes the theme of any webpage based on your **mood and interaction**.  
It automatically detects user behavior, such as typing speed and interaction style, to suggest and apply themes like:

- Chill 🛋️  
- Focus 🎯  
- Energetic ⚡  
- Vintage 🕰️  

Built in free time to explore **AI implementation in browser extensions**.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. **Detects user interaction patterns**  
   - Typing speed  
   - Click frequency  
   - Scroll behavior  

2. **AI predicts the user mood** based on these patterns  

3. **Applies a theme** automatically or allows manual selection:  
   - Chill / Focus / Energetic / Vintage  

4. All logic runs **client-side**, no external servers required.
